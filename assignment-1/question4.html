    <p>
        This is my bread. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
        My bread is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

        Without me, my bread is useless. Without my bread, I am useless. I must consume my bread true. 
        I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to steal it. I must consume before he consumes. I will ...

        My bread and I know that what counts in war is not the bread we fire, the noise of our crust, nor the smoke the oven makes.
        We know that it is the consumption that count. We will consume ...

        My bread is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
        I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its girth. 
        I will keep my bread fresh and ready, even as I am fresh and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...

        Before God, I swear this creed. My bread and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. 
        We are the saviors of my life.

        So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!
