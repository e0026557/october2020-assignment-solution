## Instructions
### Cloning the repository
Before you clone, click on the `fork` button found on the top-right of the GitHub repository. This would fork the existing repository into your own repository. **You do not need to create a repository beforehand**. Forking the repository would automatically create a new repository for you.

Once it has successfully forked, you can start cloning the repository into your own local machine. 

To clone, navigate to the directory that you wish to clone into. For Windows terminal (command prompt), you can use the following commands to move about (the symbol '<' and '>' are not part of the commands):
```
// to navigate into the specified directory
cd <name of directory>

// to check what files and folders are in the current directory
dir

// to move all the way up to the root folder
cd/.

//to move one level up to the previous folder
cd..
``` 

Once you are inside the folder you wish to clone into, use the following command to start cloning the directory (the symbol '<' and '>' are not part of the commands):
```
git clone <repository name>
```

You can find the repository name by clicking on `code` and ensure that `HTTPS` is selected. Copy the `https://github.com/...` and replace the `<repository name>` portion of the above command.

### Alternative 
If you do not wish to clone, you could navigate into the file in GitHub that you wish to look at and click on the `raw` button found at the top-right of the window. This would make it easier for you to copy the codes. 

## Submitting Issues or Requests
If you are comfortable, you may submit [`pull requests`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to this repository **after forking the repository** to make changes or add any alternative solutions to the question.
